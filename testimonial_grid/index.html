            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny's worth.

            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun!
            I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
            most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
            successfully switched careers. I'm forever grateful for this
            program."
